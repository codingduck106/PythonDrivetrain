# Attempt at coding a working robot in python

## Use as a template if and when needed.

## In order to install any module on the rio, need to run following commands:

```
$ robotpy installer download [module package name] # (while connected to internet)
$ robotpy installer install [module package name] # (while connected to robot)
```

## and to verify,

```
$ robotpy installer list (while connected to robot)
```

## this lists all the modules installed on the rio, so youu can check if the module is there or not

## Then, deploy the code, and hopefully it works.
