# Attempt at coding a working robot in python

## Use as a template if and when needed.

## In order to install phoenix6, need to run following commands:

```
$ robotpy installer download phoenix6 # (while connected to internet)
$ robotpy installer install phoenix6 # (while connected to robot)
```

## Then, deploy the code, and hopefully it works.
